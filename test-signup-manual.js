🚨 TEST 3: ERROR HANDLING

3A. Duplicate Email:

2. Should show error message like "User already registered" 
3. Form should remain filled, user stays on signup page

3B. Invalid Email Format:
1. Enter invalid email like "notanemail"  
2. Should show validation error
3. Submit button should be disabled or show error

3C. Weak Password:
1. Enter weak password like "123"
2. Should show password requirements error
3. Verify regex validation works

3D. Missing Required Fields:
1. Leave first_name or last_name empty
2. Should show "required" validation errors
3. For employers, leave company_name empty - should show error

📝 TEST 4: FORM VALIDATION

4A. Client-Side Validation:
1. Test each field individually
2. Verify error messages appear on blur/submit
3. Check that form won't submit with invalid data

4B. Server-Side Validation:
1. Bypass client validation (use dev tools)
2. Submit invalid data
3. Verify server returns appropriate errors

4C. Name Field Validation:
1. Test first_name/last_name with:
   - Special characters (should fail)
   - Numbers (should fail) 
   - Accented characters like "José" (should pass)
   - Hyphens like "Mary-Jane" (should pass)
   - Apostrophes like "O'Connor" (should pass)

🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

Database Checks (if you have access):
□ User created in auth.users table
□ Profile created in profiles table with:
  - correct role ('job-seeker' or 'employer')
  - first_name and last_name as separate fields
  - company_name for employers
  - email matches
□ Company profile created for employers
□ Generated 'name' field combines first_name + last_name

UI/UX Checks:
□ Role selection works properly
□ Form fields appear/disappear based on role
□ Loading states during submission
□ Error messages are user-friendly
□ Success states and redirects work
□ Navigation and back button work

Authentication Checks:
□ User is logged in after signup
□ Session persists on page refresh
□ Correct dashboard loads based on role
□ User can access protected routes

🐛 COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR:

1. Import errors (signupAction not found)
2. Database connection issues  
3. Validation schema mismatches
4. Redirect failures
5. Profile creation failures
6. Company profile creation issues
7. First name/last name not being stored separately
8. Role-based redirect not working
9. Error handling not showing user-friendly messages
10. Client/server validation inconsistencies
